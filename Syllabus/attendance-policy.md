> “Students are expected to attend all of their classes on a regular basis. Students who are absent for the first two classes of a semester may be removed from the class list. Instructors may establish attendance requirements in their classes and will indicate any penalties for non-attendance in their course syllabus. Instructors have the right to bar students from writing the final examination in a course when students have missed 25 per cent or more of the sessions in the course, provided this potential consequence is indicated in the course syllabus.”
