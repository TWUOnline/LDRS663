### Students with a Disability

Students with a disability who need assistance are encouraged to contact the Equity of Access Office upon admission to TWU to discuss their specific needs. All disabilities must be recently documented by an appropriately certified professional and include the educational impact of the disability along with recommended accommodations. Within the first two weeks of the semester, students must meet with their professors to agree on accommodations appropriate to each class. Students should follow the steps detailed by the Equity of Access Office on their website at: [http://www.twu.ca/life/wellness/learningresources/disabilities-and-equity-of-access/default.html](http://www.twu.ca/life/wellness/learningresources/disabilities-and-equity-of-access/default.html).
