### Syllabus Analysis (20%)

`(Is there a rubric and/or more details? Also, once they get feedback for this assignment, will they be able to re-do this part for the Handbook assignment?)`

Your work as a coach in any given learning environment will require that you be able to translate written instructions into meaningful and engaging learning activities for students. Almost always, this will happen when you have limited access to the author of the learning materials.

For this assignment, you will work with your group to evaluate the syllabus for one of the courses that TWU will offer in a FAR Centre and make recommendations for translating that syllabus into a dynamic active-learning environment.

The results of your analysis will form one section of the Instructor Handbook.

##### Product

Your analysis will include the following:
- summary of each of the learning outcomes for the course including how each outcome will be assessed
- statement of how the course aligns with TWU's Student Learning Outcomes
- an annotated bibliography of each of the main resources (textbooks and scholarly articles) used in the course including TWU Library links to electronic resources
- overview of active learning strategies used in the course
- recommendations on how active learning strategies can be enhanced for the TWU FAR Centre model
- a graphic overview (mind map) of the main topics in the course

### Completing and Submitting your Work

Prior to beginning this assignment, you must have completed the GitHub Orientation Guide, which will lead you through the process of signing up for an account with GitHub (it will be free for you as a student), forking a repository, and editing the text of a file using MarkDown.
