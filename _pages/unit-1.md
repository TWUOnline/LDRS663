<h3>Title</h3>

<h4>How People Learn</h4>

<h4>Overview</h4>

Welcome to LDRS 663 - <em>Effective coaching for transformational learning in blended learning environments</em>! We are going to get started by exploring some ideas around the nature of 'learning'.

<h4>Guiding questions</h4>

After successfully completing this unit, students will be able to answer the following questions:
* What do we really know about how people learn?
* What are the relevant differences between novices and experts?
* Given what we know about how people learn, how should we design learning environments to maximize learning?
