### Learning in Community

#### Overview
Welcome to LDRS 663 - _Coaching for Transformational Blended Learning_! In this first unit, we will begin by considering the nature of learning communities through the lens of a model called the _Community of Inquiry (CoI)_ ([Garrison et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751600000166?); [Vaughan et al., 2013](http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229)). The CoI model proposes that there are three overlapping components, or presences, to any learning environment; cognitive presence (constructing meaning), social presence (projecting a sense of yourself), and teaching presence (designing and facilitating the learning experience). The CoI model is grounded in a long history of social constructivism which is the idea that learning is fundamentally a social process {Dewey, 1916, #15747; Vygotsky, 1978, #67377}. We will also consider various modes of interaction in learning environments and how these two models have informed the model of teaching and learning in TWU FAR Centres.
