### Learning in Community

#### Overview

Welcome to LDRS 663 - _Coaching for Transformational Blended Learning_! In this first unit, we will begin by considering the nature of learning communities through the lens of a model called the _Community of Inquiry (CoI)_ ([Garrison et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751600000166?); [Vaughan et al., 2013](http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229)). The CoI model proposes that there are three overlapping components, or presences, to any learning environment; cognitive presence (constructing meaning), social presence (projecting a sense of yourself), and teaching presence (designing and facilitating the learning experience). The CoI model is grounded in a long history of social constructivism which is the idea that learning is fundamentally a social process ([Dewey, 1897](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/My_Pedagogic_Creed); [Vygotsky, 1978](https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cat05965a&AN=alc.191437&site=eds-live)). We will also consider various modes of interaction in learning environments and how these two models have informed the model of teaching and learning in TWU FAR Centres.
