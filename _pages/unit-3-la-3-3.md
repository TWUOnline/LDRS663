```When do these activities take place in the lesson? After which topic?  Could we include it with the topic - both so students can see the lesson progression and so they can refer back to the key points they should integrate into the assignment?  As a separate page, I'm a bit lost - but perhaps on a Worpress site with links to next pages it would make more sense?```

###Learning Activity 3.3: Reading 
Read Chapters 1-3 of *How people learn: Brain, mind, experience and school*, available for purchase or free download below.

###Learning Activity 3.4: Photo Safari Blog Post (...%)
```Could we include that this is a graded activity that will be worth a certain percent?```  

For your blog post this week, you are asked to complete a 12-picture Photo Safari on the theme of *learning*.
```Does the text explain what a photo safari is?  If so, please provide the page number, or explain.```

- Plan ahead and find a location where you can take pictures that symbolize learning in some way.
- Your first and last images will be of a clock (maybe screenshots from your phone) showing your beginning time and then your ending time 15 minutes later.
- Use some of the key points from your readings to inspire your images.
- Publish your photo safari on your site.
