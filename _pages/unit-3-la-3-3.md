##### Respond

Complete a 12-picture Photo Safari on the theme of *learning*.

- plan ahead and find a location where you can take pictures that symbolize learning in some way
- your first and last images will be of a clock (maybe screenshots from your phone) showing your beginning time and then your ending time 15 minutes later.
- use some of the key points from your readings to inspire your images
- publish your photo safari on your site
