### Unit 1, Topic 1

#### Learning Activity 1.1

Before you dive into the content of this first unit in LDRS627, take a moment to recall some particularly memorable learning experiences that you have had. They don't have to be particularly profound in terms of *what* you learned, but profound because of the fact that you still remember *that* you learned something and *how* you learned it. Pick one or two of those experiences and share them in a post on your blog sometime in the first couple days of this unit. Make sure to tell us about the context of your experience. Who was there? What did you do to learn? Why do you remember it? Take a few moments to read some of your colleagues' posts as well.

Remember to include the proper categories for this post, as below. These categories are critical and are specific to each individual course that you complete. Without the proper categories, you posts will not be syndicated to the correct spot on the course hub. Please create the categories on your blog exactly as they are seen here.

#### Social Constructivism

There is a very good chance that the posts you read as part of #LA1.1 included a description of some sort of social interaction with someone other than you. This isn't always the case, but the idea that learning is a social process has a long history in education. Many theorists credit John Dewey for bringing this idea to the forefront of educators' minds. In his 1897 treatise *My Pedagogic Creed* he writes:

> I believe that the school is primarily a social institution. Education being a social process, the school is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends.

The idea didn't originate with Dewey, though, as we know that in first-century Palestine there was a certain itinerant teacher whose lessons were profoundly impactful on a small group of young men and women who were called to live and learn in a deeply personal and social community.

Following Dewey, many others, such as Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Lev Vygotsky (see [Driscoll, 2005)](https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cat05965a&AN=alc.1254633&site=eds-live) have written about what has now become known as the educational theory of *social constructivism*, or, more concisely, constructivism. Driscoll (2005) describes constructivism as a theory that
> rests on the assumption that knowledge is constructed by learners as they attempt to make sense of their experiences. Learners, therefore are not empty vessels waiting to be filled, but rather active organisms seeking meaning. (p.387)

This process of seeking meaning is an iterative process whereby the learner experiences some sort of cognitive dissonance, or a disconnect between what they previously knew and some new piece of evidence or experience that disconfirms that. The learner then seeks to resolve that dissonance by either incorporating the new experience into an older schema, or by disregarding one or the other. Most often, the resulting knowledge is constructed from portions of both the new and old idea.

##### Zone of Proximal Development

Vygotsky (1978) describes how constructivism is a social process in what he calls the "zone of proximal development" (ZPD). He discovered that there are three levels of learning tasks:
1. Tasks which learners are able to complete independently.
2. Tasks which learners are unable to complete, even with assistance from a more capable or knowledgable peer.
3. Tasks which learners are able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer.

It is this third category of tasks which characterize the ZPD and are the 'sweet spot' where learners are best challenged to learn.

#### Community of Inquiry

This brings us to the idea of a 'Community of Inquiry' (CoI), which was first described by
