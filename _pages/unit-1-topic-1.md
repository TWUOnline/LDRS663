### Unit 1, Topic 1: Introduction to the Community of Inquiry Model

'''I moved this from the start page, as in the Overview we list it as a learning activity'''

#### Learning Activity 1.1: Introductions
Before we get going, please take a few moments to post and introduction to yourself on your blog. Set the featured image of your post to an image which communicates the idea of 'Community' and a short explanation for your choice.

In all of your blog posts in this course, remember to include the proper categories, as listed below. These categories are critical and are specific to each individual course that you complete. Without the proper categories, you posts will not be syndicated to the correct spot on the course hub. Please create the categories on your blog exactly as they are seen here.

'''should we also say how to add a category?'''


#### Learning Activity 1.2: My Learning Experience '''or another title'''

Before you dive into the content of this first unit in LDRS627, take a moment to recall some particularly memorable learning experiences that you have had. They don't have to be particularly profound in terms of *what* you learned, but profound because of the fact that you still remember *that* you learned something and *how* you learned it. Pick one or two of those experiences and share them in a post on your blog before you move on to the next activity. '''I'd suggest we have them do this now, as the next activity mentions posts they will have read about this''' Make sure to tell us about the context of your experience. Who was there? What did you do to learn? Why do you remember it? Take a few moments to read some of your colleagues' posts as well.

Remember to include the following categories for this post, as listed below.

#### Social Constructivism

There is a very good chance that the posts you read as part of #LA1.1 included a description of some sort of social interaction '''I deleted this last part of the sentence, as it sounded a bit awkward'''. This isn't always the case, but the idea that learning is a social process has a long history in education. Many theorists credit John Dewey for bringing this idea to the forefront of educators' minds. In his 1897 treatise *My Pedagogic Creed* he writes:

> I believe that the school is primarily a social institution. Education being a social process, the school is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends.
'''could we have a reference - page number here?'''
The idea didn't originate with Dewey, though, as we know that in first-century Palestine there was a certain itinerant teacher whose lessons were profoundly impactful on a small group of young men and women who were called to live and learn in a deeply personal and social community.

Following Dewey, many others, such as Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Lev Vygotsky (see [Driscoll, 2005)](https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cat05965a&AN=alc.1254633&site=eds-live) have written about what has now become known as the educational theory of *social constructivism*, or, more concisely, constructivism. Driscoll (2005) describes constructivism as a theory that
> rests on the assumption that knowledge is constructed by learners as they attempt to make sense of their experiences. Learners, therefore are not empty vessels waiting to be filled, but rather active organisms seeking meaning. (p.387)

This process of seeking meaning is an iterative process whereby the learner experiences some sort of cognitive dissonance, or a disconnect between what they previously knew and some new piece of evidence or experience that disconfirms that knowledge. The learner then seeks to resolve that dissonance by either incorporating the new experience into an older schema, or by disregarding one or the other. Most often, the resulting knowledge is constructed from portions of both the new and old idea.

##### Zone of Proximal Development

Vygotsky (1978) describes how constructivism is a social process in what he calls the "zone of proximal development" (ZPD). He discovered that there are three levels of learning tasks:
1. Tasks which learners are able to complete independently.
2. Tasks which learners are unable to complete, even with assistance from a more capable or knowledgable peer.
3. Tasks which learners are able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer.

It is this third category of tasks which characterize the ZPD and are the 'sweet spot' where learners are best challenged to learn.

#### Community of Inquiry

This brings us to the idea of a 'Community of Inquiry' (CoI), which was first described by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer in their 2000 article "Critical Inquiry in a text-based environment". Garrison, et al. theorize that there are three critical components, or "presences" that compose an interactive, online learning environment: Cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence. The intersection of these three presences is the heart of an educational experience.

##### Cognitive Presence
Cognitive presence, possibly the most foundational element, is the
> extent to which the participants in any particular configuration of a community of inquiry are able to construct meaning through sustained communication (p. 89).

Recall that this cognitive process is at the heart of constructivist learning environments. It seems obvious (be careful when people say that) that this construction of meaning through communication is the entire point of higher education. Your task as a student is to change your own mind, and that is a very tall order as our beliefs about many things are remarkably resilient. The way we engage in this task will have a significant bearing on the outcomes of the task.

If we approach communication with too much confidence in our own views, we can shut out competing ideas to our own detriment, so it is important to bring a cautious intelligence, or, as I heard a student describe it, epistemic humility. We all know that we are wrong about some things. The trouble is we don't know what we are wrong about and how we have misunderstood.

Cognitive presence in a text-based environment (like an online course) carries with it some affordances, but also some disadvantages. It is a relatively common experience for people to type something in a text message or an email, only to have their intentions grossly misunderstood because there are fewer para-linguistic cues in text compared to verbal face-to-face communication. Recent developments in incorporating emojis have started to change this, but emojis are generally considered to be too informal for 'serious scholarly work' or written professional communication. So, the relatively lean environment of text can lead to significant misunderstandings.

On the other hand, for learners '''I changed this, as students may think their instructor is a peer''' like me who tend toward introversion, the asynchronous nature of text-based learning environments is a huge advantage. I couldn't count the number of times that I have wanted to contribute to an in-class discussion, but needed too much time to formulate a coherent response, and before I knew it, the conversation had moved on. My point was no longer relevant, having been resolved by those in the class who were more extroverted and ready with an answer. A text-based environment, however, gives me *time to think, write, revise, and then post* my response.

##### Social Presence
Garrison, et.al. describe social presence as
>the ability of participants in the Community of Inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the community, thereby presenting themselves to the other participants as “real people.” (p. 89)

In any community, and especially the TWU community, the ability to *belong* and to be accepted as a whole and integrated person is critical to people feeling like they *actually do belong*. It is for this reason that many experienced online educators encourage a more colloquial style of writing in online forums or blogs. Strict adherence to APA or other style guides virtually eliminates self-referential language such as personal pronouns. It is hard to project your personal characteristics as a real person when you can only refer to yourself in the third person.

By allowing a more personal style and the projection of self into the community, it is thought that students will build a sense of trust in the community and feel more empowered to participate in the difficult work of changing their minds. Social presence supports cognitive presence by allowing the learning environment to be safe and welcoming.

##### Teaching Presence
This final element of the CoI model is the design and facilitation of the learning experience
>to support and enhance social and cognitive presence for the purpose of realizing educational outcomes. (p. 90).

Teaching presence can be a shared function between members of the community. Garrison, et al. point out that the design of the experience is typically performed by the teacher, and the facilitation is more often shared. In a connected course like this one, there is a greater emphasis on shared facilitation in a community of learners compared to what might be experienced in a f2f course. It is in this shared discourse in a safe environment that allows learners to engage in the difficult cognitive work of learning.

'''I'd suggest we add the learning activities here'''

#### Learning Activity 1.3
Read Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education. available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751600000166 if you are logged into the TWU library.

Create a new post on your blog and write about a time where you experienced a learning environment where the three presences described in the CoI were apparent. You can use the following questions to guide your writing.

- Were all three presences demonstrated?
- Which of the three were most obvious? Least?
- Which presence is most important for you?
- Use a unique title for your post (i.e. not 'Learning Activity 1.3') and a featured image.
