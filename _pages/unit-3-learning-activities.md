### Unit 3 Learning Activities

##### Learning Activity 3.1

  - [30-Day challenge](https://youtu.be/UNP03fDSj1U)

Your task for the next 28 days is to learn a new skill. It doesn't need to be an expensive skill, but it needs to be completely new for you. You might consider finding some tutorials on Youtube and learning to draw. Or maybe you want to learn an instrument, or learn to bake, or take better pictures, or arrange flowers. Pick something that will be relatively easy to practice, challenging to learn, and for which you will be able to see progress over 28 days. If you want some ideas or inspiration, check out the [28 Day Challenge](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/anth101challenge3/) on Instagram.
