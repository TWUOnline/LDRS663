```This is a confusing page, as it says Topic 2 but Topics 3 and 4 are here?  Let's be sure to have the titles
Topic 1: Introduction to the Community of Inquiry Model Topic 2: Characteristics of 3 presences Topic 3: Modes of Interaction Topic 4: Interaction Equivalency Theorem```

## Topic 3: Interaction
For this next topic...
```Could you confirm that the learning activity below is to be done before getting into the topic?  Perhaps add a line or two introducing the topic?```

####Learning Activity 1.4: Interaction Scenarios

Please take a few minutes to answer the following questions about scenarios that may or may not be considered 'interaction'.

[h5p id="3"]

What do you think? Do you agree with the 'correct' and 'incorrect' responses on the quiz?

Create a new blog post and discuss your responses and how you might define interaction in a learning environment.

```Should we have the commentary before the reading?  Or at least more teaching about the topic of interaction before students complete this activity?```

####Learning Activity 1.5: Reading
Read the following article by Terry Anderson
- [Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/149/230)

## Commentary
Anderson (2003) argues that, despite the lack of clarity around definitions of interaction, there seems to be a general understanding that interaction of some sort is a requirement for learning. He settles on the definition from Wagner (1994, p.8)
>reciprocal events that require at least two objects and two actions. Interactions occur when these objects and events mutually influence one another.

He provides a model of interaction in learning environments that includes three main agents in the process: students, teachers, and content (Figure 1).

###### Figure 1. Modes of Interaction from Anderson (2003).

At each point of the triangle are the agents in an educative process. The arrows between them indicate the two-way communication described by Wagner, and the recursive arrows above or below the agents are secondary forms of interaction.

### Topic 4" Interaction Equivalency Theorem ```please confirm that this topic goes here?```
For our last topic of unit 1...
Anderson (2003) also describes what he calls the *Interaction Equivalency Theorem*, stated as

>Deep and meaningful formal learning is supported as long as one of the three forms of interaction (student–teacher; student-student; student-content) is at a high level. The other two may be offered at minimal levels, or even eliminated, without degrading the educational experience.

>High levels of more than one of these three modes will likely provide a more satisfying educational experience, though these experiences may not be as cost or time effective as less interactive learning sequences. (p. 4)

At TWU, there has always been a significant emphasis placed on student-teacher interactions. This can be seen in small class sizes and opportunities for students to be involved in faculty-led research projects and travel studies. Distance education, however, has long suffered from a distinct lack of student-teacher and student-student interactions. For many years, distance education was delivered either through the post or through one-way media such as radio or TV, virtually eliminating interactions. This led to a pervasive view that distance education courses and programs were second-rate at best.

However, now that modern communication infrastructure has developed to the point that media-rich, synchronous, two-way communication is almost free, opportunities for distance learning environments to include high levels of student-student and student-teacher interaction are much more feasible.

One problem remains, though, and that is that student-teacher interaction is a scarce commodity. It is costly to hire enough faculty to enable one-on-one or small-group interaction between students and faculty. The distance educator's response to this challenge is to front-load the faculty input (high-level disciplinary expertise or cognitive presence) into the course materials and to de-couple 'interaction' from both time and place.

In an asynchronous, text-based environment, students and teachers do not need to be present in the same place at the same time in order to enjoy rich interactions.


### Other Models of Interaction
Kanuka (2011) describes a modified model of interaction which presumes that all educational interactions occur in the context of some sort of content (Figure 2.).

![](/_assets/Kanuka-Modes-of-Interaction.png)
###### Figure 2. Modes of Interaction from Kanuka (2011).

In Anderson's model, content is an agent in the process, but in Kanuka's model, content of some sort is assumed to be the foundation of learning environments and that interactions between and among learners and instructors happens in the context of making sense of the content. The content itself does not have agency.

A combination of these two models was described by Madland (2014). Madland's model, shown in figure 3, is a return to Anderson's three-sided model except with the addition of peer interactions, and all interactions between agents occuring in the context of the content that is to be learned. Also added are the three sides of the model representing structured learning activities designed specifically to enhance the educative effects of the interactions.

```Could we refer students to the article that this is from?  Link either in the paragraph or this figure?```

It is not enough to simply expect interactions between learners and instructors to be goal-oriented towards learning outcomes. Educators must design specific activities (teaching presence) to create the conditions (social presence) for learning to occur (cognitive presence). An example of this can be seen in the seemingly ubiquitous 'Group Project' assigned in so many undergraduate courses. Sometimes, groups are allowed to form themselves, other times, the instructor assigns groups, or there is some sort of random process to create groups. However they are formed, groups too often fall into a pattern of behaviour where one or two of the students do most of the work and the remaining group members engage in social loafing and benefit from their peers' work.

An alternative practice is to engage groups in a specific structured process of cooperation where everybody must do their work, or else the entire group suffers. An example is to have students work in peer review partners where students submit their assignments to their peer review partner who then provides feedback based on specific questions and categories of comments. When the original students receives their partner's feedback, they may choose how to integrate the suggestions into the final assignment that they submit to their instructor. Each student is then graded on the quality of their finished assignment, the quality of the feedback that they provided, and on the rationale for how they incorporated the peer review into their own work.

There are myriad structures that can be used to ensure that interactions are inclined towards producing student learning, and we will introduce you to some of those in unit 5.

```I moved this from the separate activities page, as some activities are with the topics, others are not.  Could we discuss the unit page structure/progression? Perhaps a different page (with activities) for each topic?  Let me know what you think.```

For each post below, ensure that your post is on-topic (defend or criticize the idea not a person) and include something that you have learned about interaction from somewhere other than the assigned readings.

If your birthday is between January 1 and June 30, create a post on your site where you defend Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem.

Each student should also create a rebuttal post which includes a counter-argument to a point from the opposite side.
