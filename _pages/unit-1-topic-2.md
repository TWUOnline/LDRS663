What do you think? Do you agree with the 'correct' and 'incorrect' responses on the quiz?

Create a new blog post and discuss your responses and how you might define interaction in a learning environment.

## Commentary
Anderson (2003) argues that, despite the lack of clarity around definitions of interaction, there seems to be a general understanding that interaction of some sort is a requirement for learning. He settles on the definition from Wagner (1994, p.8)
>reciprocal events that require at least two objects and two actions. Interactions occur when these objects and events mutually influence one another.

He provides a model of interaction in learning environments that includes three main agents in the process: students, teachers, and content (Figure 1).

###### Figure 1. Modes of Interaction from Anderson(2003)

At each point of the triangle are the agents in an educative process. The arrows between them indicate the two-way communication described by Wagner, and the recursive arrows above or below the agents are secondary forms of interaction.

Kanuka describes a modified model of interaction which presumes that all educational interactions occur in the context of some sort of content (Figure 2.).
