##### MarkDown

GitHub uses a text format called MarkDown to simplify the writing process. There are just a few keystrokes that you can use to format your writing.

The first is the # symbol, which determines the heading level of your text. For example,
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```
will be displayed as
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Similarly, for an unordered list:

```
* item
* item
  * sub-item
or
- item
- item
  - sub-item
```
will be displayed as
* item
* item
  * sub-item

or
- item
- item
  - sub-item

An ordered list:
```
1. first
2. second
3. third
```
1. first
2. second
3. third
