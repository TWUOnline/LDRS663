### Blogging
Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning on your blog. You should consider your blog as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community.

Unlike other assignments in this course, your blog will not always be written in a formal academic style, but you should (like always) give appropriate credit to other people who have informed or inspired your thoughts. This can be done with a simple mention and link as a way to say thank you, [like this](http://cogdogblog.com/2017/02/beautiful-benches-and-attribution/). Or, you could activate the 'Inline Footnotes' plugin on your blog and use footnotes to provide an attribution.

The point of your blog is to provide opportunity for you to do the work of learning in a non-threatening environment. It is expected that you will be wrong about some things, or at the very least, that there will be discrepancies between what you now believe and what you used to believe, or what your colleagues believe. This is good. We want you to change your mind, and that is difficult work.

As such, your blog won't be graded for 'accuracy' or 'being right', but instead for depth of thought and evidence that you are learning new ideas and incorporating them into your mental schema for later application. However, your blog will be a significant part of your final 'grade' (20%), so you shouldn't see it as optional.

We won't be providing specific questions for you to answer in your blog, because your questions may not be the same as our questions, and your questions are more important (to you) than ours. Nor will we specify 'x' number of posts per week, or words per post, or responses to others' posts. As long as you are posting more than 0 times per week and your posts reflect graduate-level learning (see 'Characteristics of Scholarly Posts' below), you should feel confident that you are doing your part.

`Colin, can we add notes about how it will be graded here, specifically that the blog should demonstrate the student understands the learning outcomes? Pehaps we can include the rubric here as well.)`

A brief note about logistics: if you are replying to someone else's post, please consider composing your reply on your own blog and including, on its own line, a link to the post to which you are replying. This strategy allows you to keep all of your own work under your own control. If you leave comments on other's blogs, it is easy to lose track of where they are.

### Characteristics of Scholarly posts

As you know by now, your work for this course, and also for the MA Leadership, will be open on the web. If you have concerns about your privacy, you may have signed up for your blog under a pseudonym, or maybe you plan to take other steps to protect your identity. But, regardless of how you choose to portray yourself online, your posts themselves should exhibit characteristics of academic thought.

Biggs and Collis (1982) describe the SOLO Taxonomy as a way to conceptualize the quality of academic work. They describe five levels of increasingly complex responses:

##### pre-structural
- the student response completely misses the point of the question or task

##### uni-structural
- student responses describe one characteristic related to the topic or question

##### multi-structural
- student responses describe multiple characteristics of the topic but the concepts are not related to each other in any way

##### relational
- student responses describe multiple characteristics of the topic in a way that is internally coherent and shows the relatedness of the concepts

##### extended abstract
- student responses show the same characteristics as relational responses but they are further connected to new topics or concepts.

In general, all of your academic work should be reflective of either relational or extended abstract levels of the SOLO Taxonomy. At minimum, you should be relating multiple ideas to each other in your post and explaining how those ideas connect to one or more of the course learning outcomes. The concepts that you describe can be your own new ideas compared to how you used to think and how you have changed, or you can contrast ideas from your readings with those of your classmates and your own previous misconceptions. Better than that, however, is extending your ideas to unrelated concepts. One way to do this is to apply your new learning to a problem or challenge in your own personal or professional context.
