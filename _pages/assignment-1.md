### Blogging
Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning on your blog. You should consider your blog as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community.

Your blog should not be written in a formal academic style, but you should (like always) give appropriate credit to other people who have informed or inspired your thoughts. This can be done with a simple mention and link as a way to say thank you, [like this](http://cogdogblog.com/2017/02/beautiful-benches-and-attribution/). Or, you could activate the 'Inline Footnotes' plugin on your blog and use footnotes to provide an attribution. If you'd like to go full APA, you are welcome to do that, but you are not obligated to do so.

The point of your blog is to provide opportunity for you to do the work of learning in a non-threatening environment. It will be expected that you will be wrong about some things, or at the very least, that there will be discrepancies between what you now believe and what you used to believe, or what your colleagues believe. This is good. We want you to change your mind, and that is difficult work.

As such, you blog won't be graded for 'accuracy' or 'being right', but instead for depth of thought and evidence that you are learning new ideas and incorporating them into your mental schema for later application. However, your blog will be a significant part of your final 'grade' (20%), so you shouldn't see it as optional.

We won't be providing specific questions for you to answer in your blog, because your questions may not be the same as our questions, and your questions are more important (to you) than ours. Nor will we specify 'x' number of posts per week, or words per post, or responses to others' posts. As long as you are posting more than 0 times per week and your posts reflect your learning, you should feel confident that you are doing your part.

A brief note about logistics: if you are replying to someone else's post, please consider composing your reply on your own blog and including, on its own line, a link to the post to which you are replying. This strategy allows you to keep all of your own work under your own control. If you leave comments on other's blogs, it is easy to lose track of where they are.
