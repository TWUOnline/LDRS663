### Lesson Plan Design

Working in cooperation with the local instructor of a FAR Centre course, students will design a lesson plan based on the instructions given in the FAR Centre course syllabus.

##### Product

 The lesson plan will include:
 - a summary of the learning activity or assignment,
 - an analysis of how the learning activity meets one or more learning outcomes AND one or more TWU Student Learning Outcomes.
 - a description of the actions that students will take to complete the task
   - will the students be working alone, or with a partner, or in a group?
   - how will students receive formative feedback on their work prior to submitting it for assessment?
   - what cognitive strategies will students use?
   - what artifact will students produce?
   - what will be the logistics of submitting the artifacts to the TWU faculty responsible for the course?
 - a description of common misconceptions and errors related to the subject matter of the lesson
 - strategies for presenting the lesson in diverse cultural settings
   - students will include notes specific to China, India, and Africa.

   In addition to the lesson plan, students will produce a written reflection related to the cognitive strategies they used to complete the task, how effective those strategies were, and how they will model those strategies for FAR Centre students.
