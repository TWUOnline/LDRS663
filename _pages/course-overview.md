Building on the theoretical foundations of LDRS 627, learners review coaching and facilitation strategies and, applying strategies within a learning/coaching context. Learners will develop the digital and learning literacies to maximise their ability to create and sustain communities of inquiry in alignment with the TWU FAR Centre model of teaching and learning. contemporary blended learning environments for multi-cultural higher education.

Learners will develop the academic skills to discern the credibility, accuracy, and integrity of open access resources available on the Internet and corresponding digital tools to research, analyse and present information for academic purposes. You will develop competence in a range of digital tools including: social media; communication and collaboration tools; and publishing tools to support learning in multi-cultural contexts. This will include knowledge of copyright, open licensing, media literacy and digital citizenship. By the end of the course, learners will have the beginnings of a personal cyberinfrastructure to support their work as an online learning professional.

### Program Learning Outcomes

- Demonstrate effective facilitation and coaching communication skills (eg. active listening, developing rapport, providing feedback)
- Identify a variety of facilitation/coaching methods and techniques.

### Course Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. analyze the characteristics of the coaching role within theoretical models of blended teaching and learning;
2. demonstrate the ability to model metacognitive strategies for self-regulated learning;
3. evaluate the quality of the feedback provided to students in light of relevant evidence-based research
4. create a learning environment that supports and enhances deep approaches to learning;
5. evaluate the ways that interactions occur in a learning environment and develop ideas to encourage high quality educative interactions;
6. design activities to direct cognitive and social processes to realize learning outcomes.
7. apply multi-modal communication and collaboration tools effectively in support of learning in a higher education context.
8. demonstrate the effective application of information literacies to research, produce, analyse and present information online.
9. evaluate the authority of online information from a variety of sources including open access materials, mass-media, and social media .
10. demonstrate developing ability to engage in the 5R rights of open educational resources.
