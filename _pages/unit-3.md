### Unit 3: How Do People Learn?
####Overview

Learning. We all do it almost all of the time. We are constantly taking in new information, integrating it into what we already know, and developing new ideas based on the integration of our new knowledge and our previous knowledge and experience. Yet, there seems to be a great deal of mystery, and countless myths about how the process actually works. How can we as teachers ensure that our students are actually attaining the outcomes we intend? What things should teachers do to teach? What things should learners do to learn? How can we all maximize the likelihood that learners will learn?


Here are some key questions we'll explore in this unit:

1. What does the research say about learning?
2. What are the differences between experts and novices?
3. How should teachers and learners respond to myths about learning?
4. How can we maximize learning in our classrooms?
5. What are some cultural differences in how people learn?

#### Unit Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to
- describe several learning theories.
- compare characteristics of novices and experts.
- recommend high impact learning practices for students in international learning contexts.
- analyze learning materials and recommend interactive learning activities to enhance learning.

```the 3rd lo seems a little far-reaching.  Could we delete - in any given field of knowledge.  I'm sure none of us can evaluate that for every field!!  The LO in the blueprint is more simple.  Also, do we need 'existing' in LO 4?```
