### How Do People Learn?

Learning. We all do it almost all of the time. We are constantly taking in new information, integrating it into what we already know, and developing new ideas based on the integration of our new knowledge and our previous knowledge and experience. Yet, there seems to be a great deal of mystery, and countless myths about how the process actually works. How can we as teachers ensure that our students are actually attaining the outcomes we intend? What things should teachers do to teach? What things should learners do to learn? How can we all maximize the likelihood that learners will learn?

#### Key Questions in this Unit
1. What does the research say about learning?
2. What are the differences between experts and novices?
3. How should teachers and learners respond to myths about learning?
