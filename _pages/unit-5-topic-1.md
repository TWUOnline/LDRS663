### Social Theories of Learning

The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky.

Modern conceptions of the learning process are based on the idea that knowledge is *constructed* by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a *constructivist* model of learning.

Social constructivism is the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a social process. Vygotsky's model of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is helpful in understanding how this is conceptualized. The ZPD is the 'sweet spot' in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development.
