### Course Guide Assignment

Throughout this course, you will be creating a guide that will serve as a resource for you and your colleagues while you are in a FAR Centre and also for those who are in other FAR Centres across the world.

We can't emphasize enough how important it will be for you to have thought through the model of teaching and learning that will be realized in the FAR Centres and how that will relate to your work on the ground as the front-line facilitator.

As you will be facilitating learning experiences in subjects where you may not have significant domain knowledge, it will be critical for you to be able to lead students through thinking processes that will lead to them discovering what they need to know in order to solve their questions.

There is really only one major project for you during this course, and that is to create this Course Guide based on the courses that you will be facilitating.

You will use the actual syllabi and course materials from Liberal Arts core courses in various disciplines to research and record learning strategies, common misconceptions, related resources, and other aids for you and your colleagues to be able to effectively assist students working through the course materials.

Your work in this course will be foundational and future FAR Centre Facilitators will build on your work meaning that what you do this term will live on once you have left.
