### Fork a Repo

GitHub is organized into projects called 'repositories'. Each repository (repo) is a set of related text documents, sometimes organized into folders, but not necessarily.

If you were composing in MS Word, or another word processor, a repository would be analogous to a document or file. Each file inside the repository would be analogous to major sections or chapters in your document.

In GitHub parlance, you contribute to a repo by forking it, editing your fork, then submitting a 'pull request' to the original owner of the repo. For this course, we will use GitHub Classroom to manage our assignment repositories.

To begin, go to the [Getting Started with GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/QUT5C4iy) repository to fork it to your own account. This will create an identical copy of the repo in your account, and you will be able to edit the copy without changing the original files.

Once you have forked the 'Getting Started with GitHub' repo, please add your contact information and a brief bio to the README.md file. If you would like, you can simply link to an intro post on your blog.

When you are editing text in GitHub, you will notice that there is no WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, but don't worry, it is very easy to style your text in GitHub using what is known as MarkDown.

### Markdown Guide

MarkDown is a very simple set of keystrokes that you can use to style your text specifically for the web. Here are the basics that you will need.

##### Headings

In MS Word, there are a couple ways to create a heading, and many different required formats for headings depending on which style guide you are using (APA, MLA, etc.). If you want a particular chunk of text to be formatted as Heading 1, you need to select the text that you want to edit, then select the 'Style' menu and choose Heading 1. You should always avoid manually changing the size, emphasis, and other embellishments (underline, italics) using the tools in Word. So, to set a chunk of text as Heading 1, you need to DO something to that text.

On the contrary, using MarkDown, all you have to do to set a chunk of text to Heading 1 is to add a single `#` followed by a space prior to the text you want to style, so that

```
# Heading 1
```
is displayed as

# Heading 1

To use Heading 2, you add '##' followed by a space.

```
## Heading 2
```
becomes

## Heading 2

You can use up to six levels of headings just by changing the number of '#' you use.
