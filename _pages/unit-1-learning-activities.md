### Unit 1 Learning Activities

##### Learning Activity 1.2
- Ensure that you have signed up for GitHub.com.
- See the [GitHub Guide](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs663/github-guide/) if you need assistance.

##### Learning Activity 1.3

- Read *Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education.* available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751600000166 if you are logged into the TWU library.

- Create a new post on your blog and write about a time where you experienced a learning environment where the three presences described in the CoI were apparent. You can use the following questions to guide your writing.
  - Were all three presences demonstrated?
  - Which of the three were most obvious? Least?
  - Which presence is most important for you?
- Use a unique title for your post (i.e. not 'Learning Activity 1.3') and a featured image.
- Use these categories
  - ldrs663
  - coi

##### Learning Activity 1.4

- Create a response post on your own site where you synthesize a few of your colleagues' ideas and respond with your own thoughts.
- Make sure you link to your colleagues' posts within your own post as a way to provide credit and say thanks.

##### Learning Activity 1.5

- Read *Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction* by [Terry Anderson](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/149/230)
- Read *Interaction and the online distance classroom: Do instructional methods effect the quality of interaction?* by [Heather Kanuka](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12528-011-9049-4)

For each post below, ensure that your post is on-topic (defend or criticize the *idea* not a *person*) and include something that you have learned about interaction from somewhere other than the assigned readings.

###### If your birthday is between January 1 and June 30, create a post on your site where you defend Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem.

###### If your birthday is between July 1 and December 31, create a post on your site where you criticize Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem
- Categories

###### Each student should also create a rebuttal post which includes a counter-argument to a point from the opposite side.
