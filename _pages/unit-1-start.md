### Unit 1 - Getting Started

Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to cooperatively contribute to documents. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. Normally, you might not think too much about the difference between a 'cooperative' tool and a 'collaborative' tool. After all, it's all just another 'group project' where one person does all the work and everyone gets the credit, right? Well, no.

Cooperative learning environments are specifically structured to prevent the social loafing that is sometimes common in group projects. Johnson and Johnson [(1999)](https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat05965a&amp;AN=alc.40863&amp;site=eds-live) describe 5 key characteristics of cooperative learning environments:
- positive interdependence,
- individual and group accountability,
- promotive interaction,
- appropriate use of social skills, and
- group processing.
