### GitHub

Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to cooperatively contribute to documents. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. GitHub shares some similarities with Google Docs, but there are also some important differences.

These differences will become apparent as you become familiar with GitHub, but for now, just keep in mind that GitHub doesn't have the same 'real-time collaboration' that you see in Google Docs, where multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and everyone can see everyone else's changes in real-time.

We've created a [Github Guide](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs663/github-guide/) for you to get started with GitHub.

If this all sounds overwhelming, don't worry, we will walk you through each of the skills that you will need to navigate in GitHub.



### Cooperative Learning

Normally, you might not think too much about the difference between a 'cooperative' tool and a 'collaborative' tool. After all, it's all just another 'group project' where one person does all the work and everyone gets the credit, right? Well, no.

Cooperative learning environments are specifically structured to prevent the social loafing that is sometimes common in group projects. Johnson and Johnson [(1999)](https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat05965a&amp;AN=alc.40863&amp;site=eds-live) describe 5 key characteristics of cooperative learning environments:
- positive interdependence,
- individual and group accountability,
- promotive interaction,
- appropriate use of social skills, and
- group processing.
