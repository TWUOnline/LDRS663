### Unit 1 - Getting Started

##### Introductions

Before we get going, please take a few moments to post and introduction to yourself on your blog. Set the featured image of your post to an image which communicates the idea of 'Community' and a short explanation for your choice.

##### Categories for this post:
- ldrs663
- hi
```
Could you explain categories for students and what you'd like them to do with them?
```

``` I'm not sure if we need the next few sections here.  Do they mostly relate to an assignment?  (When do they start using Github?)  If you want to keep any of the content here, perhaps an intro - such as "This course depends on Cooperative Learning, Positive Interdependence, etc."  We can always introduce them when they start their group work. ```

### GitHub
```This section in particular may be overwhelming.  Let's get them into the course and then explain more when they need to use it.  If you want to mention briefly that they'll be using Github - but assure them they'll learn more about it later - then that could make more sense```

Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to cooperatively contribute to documents. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. GitHub shares some similarities with Google Docs, but there are also some important differences.

These differences will become apparent as you become familiar with GitHub, but for now, just keep in mind that GitHub doesn't have the same 'real-time collaboration' that you see in Google Docs, where multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and everyone can see everyone else's changes in real-time.

We've created a [Github Guide](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs663/github-guide/) for you to get started with GitHub.

If this all sounds overwhelming, don't worry, we will walk you through each of the skills that you will need to navigate in GitHub.


### Cooperative Learning

Normally, you might not think too much about the difference between a 'cooperative' tool and a 'collaborative' tool. After all, it's all just another 'group project' where one person does all the work and everyone gets the credit, right? Well, no.

Cooperative learning environments are specifically structured to prevent the social loafing that is sometimes common in group projects. Johnson and Johnson [(N.D.)](http://www.co-operation.org/what-is-cooperative-learning/) describe 5 key characteristics of cooperative learning environments:
- positive interdependence,
- individual and group accountability,
- promotive interaction,
- appropriate use of social skills, and
- group processing.

##### Positive Interdependence

Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn 'A' grades.

##### Individual and Group Accountability

In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the 'social loafing' that is common in typical 'group projects'.

##### Promotive Interaction

Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work *and* the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge.

##### Interpersonal Skills

Not only do members of the group need to learn the *content* of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the *process* of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills.

##### Group Processing

Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals.

### GitHub

Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to *cooperatively* contribute to documents. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. GitHub shares some similarities with Google Docs, but there are also some important differences.

These differences will become apparent as you become familiar with GitHub, but for now, just keep in mind that GitHub doesn't have the same 'real-time collaboration' that you see in Google Docs, where multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and everyone can see everyone else's changes in real-time.

We've created a [Github Guide](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs663/github-guide/) for you to get started with GitHub.

If this all sounds overwhelming, don't worry, we will walk you through each of the skills that you will need to navigate in GitHub.

Aside from the workflow benefits that we think you will begin to appreciate in using GitHub, it is also important for your work in a FAR Centre that you understand how to use GitHub as the content for each of your FAR Centre courses will be managed and deployed from GitHub.

GitHub is a tool that will allow everybody to see who has contributed and exactly what they have contributed to assignments in this course. It is a tool that will promote both positive interdependence and individual and group accountability throughout the entire process.
