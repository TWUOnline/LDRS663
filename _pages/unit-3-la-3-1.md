####Learning Activity 3.1: Challenge!
```
Where does this activity take place? What does it connect with?  Could I suggest we keep it with the topics and then separate them if it makes sense for the flow of the course?  As it is now, it's difficult to see the flow of the unit.  Also, perhaps we need an intro sentence to relate it to the topic.
```

Check out [this challenge](http://anth101.com/challenge3/) from the open online course *Anthropology 101: The Art of Being Human*

Your task for the next 28 days is to learn a new skill. It doesn't need to be an expensive skill, but it needs to be completely new for you. You might consider finding some tutorials on Youtube and learning to draw. Or maybe you want to learn an instrument, or learn to bake, or take better pictures, or arrange flowers. Pick something that will be relatively easy to practice, challenging to learn, and for which you will be able to see progress over 28 days. If you want some ideas or inspiration, check out the [28 Day Challenge](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/anth101challenge3/) on Instagram.

This week, you should publish more than two updates. The first should be an introduction to your challenge, including why you chose that particular challenge. You are encouraged to upload media such as photos, video, or audio of your practice sessions.

Please publish regular updates for the three weeks following this week of the course.

```I'm a little surprised by this activity as it seems like an extra major assignment. Is this an optional learning activity (most should be formative and ungraded), or part of the assigned blog that is graded?  Could we be clear about this for students?  Also, does it meet the learning outcomes for the unit/course?  I think it's a fantastic activity, and I think we should strongly encourage students to take the challenge, however, does it distract from other learning/assignments?  Learning Github may be a great challenge for students, so I'm wondering about the workload here.```
