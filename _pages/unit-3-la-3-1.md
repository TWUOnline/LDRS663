Check out [this challenge](http://anth101.com/challenge3/) from the open online course *Anthropology 101: The Art of Being Human*

Your task for the next 28 days is to learn a new skill. It doesn't need to be an expensive skill, but it needs to be completely new for you. You might consider finding some tutorials on Youtube and learning to draw. Or maybe you want to learn an instrument, or learn to bake, or take better pictures, or arrange flowers. Pick something that will be relatively easy to practice, challenging to learn, and for which you will be able to see progress over 28 days. If you want some ideas or inspiration, check out the [28 Day Challenge](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/anth101challenge3/) on Instagram.

This week, you should publish more than two updates. The first should be an introduction to your challenge, including why you chose that particular challenge. You are encouraged to upload media such as photos, video, or audio of your practice sessions.

Please publish regular updates for the three weeks following this week of the course.
